## Dataset Download

To participate in the challenge, you must first download the new **Challenge version of the Condensed Movies dataset.** Use the following instructions to download the challenge version of the Condensed Movies dataset:

1) Clone this repository.

2)  **Download the dataset**. First, you can optionally choose where to download the features to. To do this, in [scripts/download_dataset.sh](https://github.com/m-bain/CondensedMovies-chall/blob/main/scripts/download_dataset.sh "download_dataset.sh") edit the variable "Output_Directory" to give the path to where you would like the visual features to be downloaded to. By default the features will be downloaded to the directory "dataset". The dataset totals xGB.  Second, download the dataset. Run "cd scripts", and "./download_dataset.sh".
